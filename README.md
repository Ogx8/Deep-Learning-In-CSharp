# **Derp** : A **De**ep learning in C sha**rp**.

**Derp** is a small DDF neural network generation and training lib written in C#.
It works entirely with builtin arrays and term by term calculations. Performances are ok for CPU computation, but it's better to use proofed, multithreaded or even GPU libraries for real work.

A sample is included for stock predictions, but results are obviously wrong for now as RNN are not implemented in this library yet.

This library was written for my own learning of machine learning topics.
